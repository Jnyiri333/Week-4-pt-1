## Confidence interval practice
```{r}
otter_length<-c(38,41,50,27,32,41,48,60,43)

t.test(otter_length)

#See a claim that mean otter length is 50 inches
#Want to test that using my samples, don't think real mean is 50 in.
#mu is the null hypothesis, so this is asking if null hypothesis
#'mean is 50' is true
otter_test<-t.test(x = otter_length, mu=50)
```

```{r}
#two sample t-test
sample_1_hornlength<-c(32,44,18,26,50,33,42,20)
sample_2_hornlength<-c(28,31,40,42,26,29,31)
#enter two separate samples to t.test to compare two samples
#for two-sample t-test

sample_test_results <- t.test(x=sample_1_hornlength, y= sample_2_hornlength)
#p value here means 88% chance that pops have same actual mean
#meaning the samples were drawn from popl'n
sample_test_results
